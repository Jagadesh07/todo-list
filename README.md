- Delete tasks.
- State is preserved when adding or deleting tasks.

## What I learned
- Using arrays and objects to store task data.
- Dynamically generating HTML based on data.
- Adding event listeners for checkboxes and buttons.
- Using `closest()` and `data-index` attributes.
- Applying styles conditionally with JavaScript.

## Things to improve
